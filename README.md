# About Cyclistic

This analysis is based on a virtual business scenario, in which the company is called "Cyclistic", but the data is real data (public data from Divvy bikes in Chicago). Data from Sep 2020 to Aug 2021 is used for this analysis.

The analysis can be found in the slides.

# The Scenario

Our financial analysis has concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual users. To maximize the number of annual members while avoiding costly campaigns to raise awareness, we can convert current casual users into members. This would be a key to long-term growth.
This is why we want to design marketing strategies to convert these casual riders into members. To do that, we first need to identify how members and casual users use Cyclistic bikes differently.
